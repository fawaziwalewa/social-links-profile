- View the page's layout across different screen sizes for responsiveness.

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

This project gave me the opportunity to reinforce the importance of responsive design using Tailwind CSS and semantic HTML. I also focused on creating smooth hover effects and ensuring accessibility through proper `aria` attributes.

Hereâ€™s an example of a hover effect I implemented:

```css
a:hover {
  background-color: var(--green);
  color: var(--grey-700);
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on improving accessibility for screen readers and implementing dark mode functionality from the start. I also plan to explore CSS animations to add more interactivity to my designs.

### Useful Resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Helped me implement utility classes effectively.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Always my go-to for learning about semantic HTML and CSS properties.
